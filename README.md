# ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

Create a small Jupyter (IPython) Notebook about one aspect of data structures that you
 might find somewhat challenging, such as set comprehensions, or using the zip() 
 function.  Your Jupyter Notebook should include both code and some documentation, which 
 should utilize Markdown.
