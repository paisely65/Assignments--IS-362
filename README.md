# ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

Create a small Jupyter (IPython) Notebook about one aspect of data structures that you
 might find somewhat challenging, such as set comprehensions, or using the zip() 
 function.  Your Jupyter Notebook should include both code and some documentation, which 
 should utilize Markdown. 
 
 This notebook was created in Jupiter and focuses on dictionaries, a very useful but complicated data type used in Python.
 Understanding the methods can be quite challenging hence I chose to try to break it down here. Breaking the code down to small bits has been one of the methods I used to practice dictionaries before attempting to manage large data sets
